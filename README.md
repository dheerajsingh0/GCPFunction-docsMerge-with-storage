## Google Cloud Function for File Merging to PDF

### Overview

This repository contains a Google Cloud Function designed to merge various file types (e.g., PDFs, Excel files, images) from a specified source in Google Cloud Storage. After processing and merging these files into a single PDF, the function updates the database with the relevant details and subsequently saves the merged PDF back into the designated Google Cloud Storage source.

### Features

1. **Versatility in File Types**: Can process a variety of file formats including PDFs, Excel files, and images.
2. **File Merging**: Seamlessly merges multiple files into a single PDF.
3. **Database Update**: Updates the database with details of the merged PDF.
4. **Storage Integration**: Reads from and saves back to Google Cloud Storage.

### Prerequisites

1. **Google Cloud SDK**: Ensure you've [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and initialized.
2. **Proper IAM permissions**: Your service account or user must have adequate permissions to read/write from/to Google Cloud Storage and the necessary permissions for the target database.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: 

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/repository_name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd repository_name
   ```

3. **Deploy the Function**:

   ```

### Configuration

Ensure that you've set up environment variables or configuration files that point to the correct Google Cloud Storage source and the target database.
